Description: Contains a range of functions covering the present
  development of the distributional method for the dichotomisation of continuous outcomes. 
  The method provides estimates with standard error of a comparison of proportions 
  (difference, odds ratio and risk ratio) derived, with similar precision, from a comparison of means.
